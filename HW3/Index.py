Torchvision provides lots of useful utilities for image preprocessing, data wrapping as well as data augmentation.

Here, since our data are stored in folders by class labels, we can directly apply **torchvision.datasets.DatasetFolder** for wrapping data without much effort.

Please refer to [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) for details about different transforms.

You can finish supervised learning by simply running the provided code without any modification.

The function "get_pseudo_labels" is used for semi-supervised learning.
It is expected to get better performance if you use unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning.
However, you have to implement the function on your own and need to adjust several hyperparameters manually.

For more details about semi-supervised learning, please refer to [Prof. Lee's slides](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/courses/ML_2016/Lecture/semi%20(v3).pdf).

    Last but not least, don't forget to save the predictions into a single CSV file.

    3.   sharing predictions with others,
    4.   copying codes from any creatures on Earth,
    5.   asking other people to do it for you.

    Any violations bring you punishments from getting a discount on the final grade to failing the course.

    It is your responsibility to check whether your code violates the rules.
